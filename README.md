# Kitchen-Fad
Kitchen Fad is a food blog or website where users can look up recipes, share their
recipes and form a community where all kinds of food and kitchen-based discussions
take place. In recent years, the popularity of blogging has skyrocketed. We've seen the
rise of digital media, which will only grow in popularity as time goes on, and new social
media platforms appear every other week. This blog provides a platform to invite more
people to share their stories and build a community.
It consists of a homepage, a page for introducing recipes, a page consisting of all recipes,
a community page, a donation page and many more where users can pose questions and
provide answers for existing questions asked by many other users

Frontend
For this website, HTML and PHP have been used to create various dynamic webpages.
The pages have been designed using CSS. A few pages required form validation or other
aspects and that has been done using JavaScript. The whole thing has been coded on
Visual Studio Code.

Backend
The database has been connected using the MySQL port on the XAMPP panel. The user
information has been stored here. MongoDB has also been used to store the user
records in collections.
